# Favicon Setup Instructions

Your favicon is now configured! Here's what I added:

## What was configured:

1. **Browser tab icon** - Your logo will appear in browser tabs
2. **Bookmark icon** - Shows when users bookmark your site  
3. **Apple touch icon** - For iOS devices when users add to home screen
4. **Social media previews** - Your logo will show when the site is shared on social media

## Files being used:

- `/logo.png` - Your main logo file in the public folder

## For even better compatibility:

If you want to create different sized favicons for optimal display:

1. **Create a 32x32 pixel version** of your logo and save it as `/public/favicon-32x32.png`
2. **Create a 16x16 pixel version** and save it as `/public/favicon-16x16.png`  
3. **Create a 192x192 pixel version** for Android and save it as `/public/icon-192x192.png`

You can use online tools like:

## Next.js App Directory Method:

Alternatively, you can simply copy your logo to:
- `/app/icon.png` (Next.js will automatically use this as favicon)
- `/app/apple-icon.png` (For Apple devices)

The current setup will work perfectly, but creating these optimized sizes will give you the best results across all devices and browsers.
